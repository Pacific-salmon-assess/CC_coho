data_wrangling.R - something to source()


Notes from chat:
Coho_SR_model_DRAFT3
make robust for new years, 
Harvest Rate Plots.R - first 40 lines is good spot to look at wrangling
get script where we have one stop shop of data merging (creek by year) with all data 

3 models - mean reverting, RW, trending
6 versions of running it 
1-fit data
2-fwd projections
... for each model 

appendix 3 is a good resource for sorting out what CVs to use 

get the wrangling code sorted before I fuck off
