Note:  The ""(RC) Sample Run Code"" field is easily confused with the run of the recovery but it is in fact the run of all fish in the sample and will only have values in it if a sampling experiment was set up sample a specific run. There is no ""(RC) Run Code"" field on the recovery table, meaning that the run is not recorded for each recovery. The exception to this is  escapement recoveries, where the ""(RC) Sample Period Code"" field contains the run season and ""(RC) Sample Period Type Code""=8. For other recoveries, if you wish to query the a specific run code, you must assume that the recovery had the same run code as the release group and select ""(RL) Run Code"" as your criteria column."

Used only for Canadian recoveries that are part of a sample that was stratified by sex. For US recoveries, see also Sample Maturity Code.

Note: The ""(RC) Sample Sex Code"" field is easily confused with the sex of the recovery but it is, in fact, the sex of all fish in the sample and will only have values if the sampling experiment was set up to sample a specific sex.

For troll or net recoveries:
Estimated number = A X C/S, where, for a particular stratum,  where A is the number of adjusted recoveries, C is the total estimated catch, and S is the number of fish in the sample.

For sport recoveries:
E = A X ( C / (O* X S / MI ) ), where A is the number of adjusted recoveries, C is the total estimated catch, O* is the the number of heads with known tagcodes, lost-pins, and a portion of the no-datas turned into the decoding lab, S is the number of fish in the sample and MI is the incidence of Marked fish in the sample.
