Salmon were observed above the fence prior to fence installation with pink, chum and and coho being caught in the trap box on Sept. 4. The section of stream from the fence to 2+000m was floated (swim) on Sept. 4 for a count of 190 pink, 51 chum & 26 coho.

The adult coho population is estimated at 1262 (95% CI = 1220 - 1309) and the jack population 141 (95% CI 141-147) subject to further review.

Pink and chum estimates are based on the number of fish counted upstream of the fence on Sept. 4, fish counted through the fence after this date and counts of fish spawning downstream of the fence.
